Designing a Python function for AWS Lambda that initiates a billing export with the ability to expand for more granular details involves creating a modular and extensible codebase. Below is a conceptual design that outlines how you could structure this function and its expansion capabilities. This design assumes you are using AWS Cost and Usage Reports to generate the billing export and AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services.

### Core Concepts for Expansion:

1. **Modularity**: Design the function in separate modules or classes, each responsible for a specific part of the process (e.g., setting up the report, exporting data, handling granular details).

2. **Configuration Driven**: Utilize external configuration (e.g., environment variables, configuration files stored in S3) to manage the details of the reports, making it easy to adjust what data is exported without changing the code.

3. **Template Method Pattern**: If you anticipate different kinds of billing reports (e.g., summary vs. detailed), consider using the Template Method design pattern. This allows you to define the skeleton of the operation in a base class and let subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

### Expanding for More Granular Details:

- **Granular Detail Modules**: For more granular details, you can create additional methods in `ReportGenerator` or even separate classes that handle specific types of detailed reports.

- **Configuration Updates**: As you add capabilities, update the configuration structure to include options for these new details, allowing users of your function to customize the reports generated.

- **Integrate Additional AWS Services**: Depending on the details required, you might need to integrate other AWS services. For example, using AWS S3 for storing reports, or AWS Glue and Athena for querying large datasets.

- **External Libraries**: Consider using external libraries for complex data processing or report generation (e.g., Pandas for data analysis, Jinja2 for generating report templates).

This design provides a foundation that you can build upon to add more sophisticated features and granular control over the billing reports your Lambda function generates. Always consider AWS service limits and Lambda execution time limits when designing your solution.
